What is DateSlider ?
====================

It is an dialog which can be used in a similar way to the default DatePicker or TimePicker
dialog. Its main advantages are a slide based interface and features such as a minimum or maximum
date, or a minute interval for the time picker variant 


How To Install for Eclipse users
================================

Its implemented as android library, so as the first import DateSlider-lib into your workspace.
You need at least ADT17 (because support of custom atributes in layouts).


How To Install for maven users
================================

The project is not in maven central repository, so you can build and install the lib localy from  DateSlider-lib

  mvn clean install
  
Define dependecy in your project's pom.xml (see Demo project in DateSlider-Demo)  

 <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.googlecode.android.widgets.DateSlider</groupId>
      <artifactId>DateSlider-lib</artifactId>
      <type>apklib</type>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  

If you want to use any other dateslider implementation just follow the dependencies. (I hope the
names of the files should give some clues about whether or not they are needed for a certain
implementation)

Changes
=========

1.1
---------
the core algorithm was rewritten from scratch to make it faster, smoother, less memory expensive and
easier to adapt

1.1.2
- - - - -
added a setTime() method to update the time after the dialog has been first invoked
fixed a bug which occurred when dealing with time zones other than the default time zone 

1.2
---------
A massive thanks to [Ben Demboski] who spend a lot of invaluable work in refactoring this project. 
He made some big changes in the code base to make it very easy to expand and modify the dateslider's 
look and behaviour.

now the dateslider supports time ranges which can be open

it's straight forward to incorporate a minute interval such that only multiples of this interval
are displayed.

the designed was refined. It is now based on an xml file and shadows at the border were included
